# WebBS-Calculator

Live demo of Web Bloat Score Calculator: https://www.webbloatscore.com/

## How to run the project
WebBS-Calculator uses the [SlimmerJS](https://github.com/laurentj/slimerjs) scriptable browser that requires Firefox version 48 or older to be installed on your computer.
You can download it from Mozzila's [archive](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/48.0/). 

If you donâ€™t choose the default install location (C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox 48\firefox.exe), you need to let SlimmerJS know by modifying the [WebBloatScore/Slimerjs/slimmer.bat](https://github.com/ZSvedic/WebBS-Calculator/blob/master/WebBloatScore/Slimerjs/slimerjs.bat)
file on lines [202](https://github.com/ZSvedic/WebBS-Calculator/blob/master/WebBloatScore/Slimerjs/slimerjs.bat#L202) and [203](https://github.com/ZSvedic/WebBS-Calculator/blob/master/WebBloatScore/Slimerjs/slimerjs.bat#L203) with the path you chose during the installation.

After that you can simply run the WebBloatScore ASP.NET MVC application.
 
## Calculation
As described on https://www.webbloatscore.com/, the web bloat score is calculated as `WebBS = TotalPageSize / PageImageSize`

In the project the calculation is happening in the [SlimmerExecutor](https://github.com/ZSvedic/WebBS-Calculator/blob/master/WebBloatScore/Models/SlimerExecutor.cs) class:
1. First SlimmerJS is [executed](https://github.com/ZSvedic/WebBS-Calculator/blob/master/WebBloatScore/Models/SlimerExecutor.cs#L70). It creates and stores a screenshot of the web page and returns the total size of the page.
2. After that [PngQuant](https://github.com/kornelski/pngquant) library is used to [optimize](https://github.com/ZSvedic/WebBS-Calculator/blob/master/WebBloatScore/Models/SlimerExecutor.cs#L125) the screenshot of the page.
3. In the end the result with all values necessary to calculate WebBS is [returned](https://github.com/ZSvedic/WebBS-Calculator/blob/master/WebBloatScore/Models/SlimerExecutor.cs#L110).

## Performance
The tasks necessary to calculate the score are time-consuming and depending on the hardware can take several minutes to complete.
Therefore the [timeout](https://github.com/ZSvedic/WebBS-Calculator/blob/master/WebBloatScore/Controllers/HomeController.cs#L93) is used
to limit the execution time. On top of that [caching](https://github.com/ZSvedic/WebBS-Calculator/blob/master/WebBloatScore/Controllers/HomeController.cs#L85) of the most used [websites](https://github.com/ZSvedic/WebBS-Calculator/blob/master/WebBloatScore/Utilities.cs#L16) is used to save resources.
